### Theoretical Cryptography:
I am currently working under the guidance of Professor Marshall Ball, exploring a number of ideas related to public-key cryptography. In particular we want to expand on a 2020 paper that showed the existence of Chosen-Ciphertext Attack Security (CCA-Security) from Injective Trapdoor Functions (https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/759). This exploration has included reading a number of classic texts related to CCA-Security from Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge proofs. These traditional methods often use blackbox principles in which CCA-Security is derived from select cryptographic primitives. Likewise, we have analyzed applied approaches to this problem of CCA-Security/NIZKs in which cryptographic objects are directly derived from computational assumptions (Learning with Errors, Learning Parity with Noise, etc.)

### Applied Cryptography:

#### Bloxchain: 
Built at ETHDenver2024, one of the biggest hackathons in the world, Bloxchain provides a decentralized space where individuals can create videogames, monetize these games, and sell stock in their games. In particular, each game is treated as a cryptographic object which can be split and thus partially owned by different parties. Such a site could provide a sort of "stock market" that would allow individual creators to generate liquidity, promoting an environment in which developers could design better games that would be continuously developed over time.

For a full description of the project's philosophy, alongside pictures and an explanatory video, see [project1](https://devfolio.co/projects/bloxchain-dea0).

#### Red VS Blue:
Built at the Onchain Summer Buildathon. Red VS Blue creates a platform in which players can join a team, stake a coin, and compete in challenges to pump up the value of their coin. In designing this game we gained more experience with Solidity, especially in regards to designing secure cryptographic tokens and using basic financial principles to mediate the value of these tokens through the use of (decentralized) smart contracts.

### Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

#### Bitcoin Predictive Model:
Used a number of financial indicators to predict the price of Bitcoin. This current model is monetizable (not for any large sum) so it will not be presented in full. That being said, I am happy to answer any questions in person.

#### NFL Predictive Model:
The hope is to create a monetizable model so this will not be presented in full. That being said, I am happy to answer any questions in person.
